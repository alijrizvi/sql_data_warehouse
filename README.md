# Data Engineering: Building a SQL Data Warehouse

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a full-scale Data Warehouse - instead of a Data Lake or Date Lakehouse - based on Medallion Architecture, in pgAdmin4 using PostgreSQL.

This project involves:

* Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
* ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
* Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
* Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

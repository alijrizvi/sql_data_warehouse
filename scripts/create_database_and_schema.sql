/*

This script is focused on (Creating a Database and) defining the Schema for the 
3 Layers - Bronze, Silver, and Gold - of the Database of this project.

Since I did not need to write a script to Create a Database this time
(i.e., using "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS..."), I proceeded straight to coding
for defining the Schema.
